        <p class="articlePageTitle">Queer Bodies Through a Queer Lense</p>

          &emsp;Throughout history, the depiction of queer bodies in film, art, and advertisement has been both misrepresented and underrepresented. This is prominent through both the oversexualization and fetishization of queer women and lesbians by men, as their portrayal of lesbianism tends to be an inaccurate reflection of the lives and individuality of these people. In fact, “...the writing staff of The New York Times deployed, generated, and keyed frameworks that directly impacted their readership’s perception of the gay and lesbian community” (Strahan, page ii). Although the male gaze has impacted women of all sexualities and races, there is a prominent emphasis on depicting queerness as an exotic spectacle, which does nothing but perpetuate a false set of ideals and a generalized narrative of those queer women and lesbians living in the margins of art and media. This is usually done through the medium of film and photography, as both of these industries are still predominantly male, cisgendered, white and heteronormative.
<br>&emsp;Exploring how the male gaze has affected the ways in which queerness is understood in a heteronormative and misogynistic society has already been spoken about for several decades. Although it is an incredibly valuable and valid conversation to have, the related nuances of the representation and depiction of queer bodies by lesbians is often dismissed. Looking across the work of 1970s lesbian filmmaker Barbara Hammer and contemporary lesbian photographer Zanele Muholi, exemplify the ways in which queer bodies can be reclaimed by observing and depicting them through queer lenses. Comparing and contrasting the varied depictions of queerness through film and photography allows current and future generations to observe and understand how both the lesbian community and the representation of queer bodies has evolved. Hammer and Muholi’s experiences as lesbians from different countries and time periods influenced their work, allowing their individualized narratives of queerness to become integral to the evolution of the LGBTQ+ community in media and in reality.
<br>&emsp;Barbara Hammer explores lesbian sexuality and women’s bodily autonomy through explicit films, photographs, and performances. Hammer’s work was a partial response to the second wave of feminism in the 70s, which was much more inclusive than the first wave of feminism, this time opening up toward women of color and queer folks. Dyketactics (Stills) are still frames of a four minute long film made by Hammer in 1974 that depicts women interacting with their own bodies, other women’s bodies, and nature. The stills from the piece include imagery of women’s genitalia, leafs, flowers, and fields that intersect and fade into one another on the screen, at times becoming one. Most of the women are nude, some lounging in groups in the middle of a field, while others engage in sexual activities or casual conversation. One of the stills highlighted from the film is of a nude woman sitting on a mirror with a camera, taking pictures of her genital’s reflection in the mirror, showing how Hammer takes the concept of the male gaze and completely eradicates it.
<br>&emsp;Hammer’s creative vision and disregard of the male gaze on lesbian media is intrinsic to the creation of the piece itself, as it was made by a lesbian for lesbians. The lense through which all of this footage was captured was queer, meaning that the narrative of Hammer’s queerness was integrated into this piece, as well as her other work. In an interview with Sarah Keller, she said that the process of making the piece was like “you’re just burning with your own energy” and that she felt a “freedom of expression” while crafting the piece (Hammer, International Journal of Screendance, Vol. 3, page 62). Considering that there was no content in experimental film with such an explicitly lesbian focus, her work was considered to be extremely radical at the time, especially considering that it was created during an era in which women wearing pants was seen as masculanizing or abnormal.
<br>&emsp;Two years prior to Dyketactics, the non-binary South African artist Zanele Muholi was born. Muholi is a prominent figure in South Africa’s queer art movement and oftentimes makes both their blackness and their lesbianism the main focus of their work, which usually means delving into their country’s recent and tumultuous history of racial and queer violence. Since the early 2000s Muholi has used photography to capture these subjects, their more recent works becoming introspective, such as their series Somnyama Ngonyama. The name of this series means “Hail the Dark Lioness” when translated from Zulu, Muholi’s native language, and they are all self portraits of Muholi. Bona, Charlottesville is a black and white photograph taken in 2015 that shows Muholi laying down on their bed with the back of their head facing the audience, a mirror held up over their body so that the viewer can see their face in the reflection. Their hair is done up in intricate braids and patterned sheets drape down in the background, highlighting the prominence of their culture. The scene itself seems intimate and explorative of the body, as the placement of the mirror both obscures parts of their body, but reveals their facial expression. This allows the viewer to see a person, a black lesbian person, who is reclaiming their body after history has told them for so long that it was never theirs to cherish or love. Muholi has always “[...] refused to become subject matter for others and be silenced,” which further exemplifies their drive to define their own narrative (Mullins, page 102).
<br>&emsp;In both Hammer’s Dyketactics and Muholi’s Bona, Charlottesville the camera is used as a reflection of their experiences and identities as lesbians. For Hammer, this meant being surrounded by mostly white or white-passing cisgendered women, as that was the community that she most related herself to and found to be true to her own experience as a cisgendered white woman. This may seem like a jab or critique of her work for not being inclusive enough or having shown inaccurate representation, but it is not. Her art is a genuine depiction of her community, which is just as valid and honest as Muholi’s depiction of their community, even though it differs greatly as Muholi’s community includes more transgender and queer black people. This is in no way saying that one form of representation is any better than the other, as stated previously. This statement was simply made to showcase the varied depictions of queerness through film and photography that has happened over time. In showing queer bodies, whether they were transgender or cisgender, black or white, Hammer and Muholi told their respective stories in ways that were precedental.
<br>&emsp;Mirrors are also used in each artists’ work to explore visceral depictions of the body in relation to the self, functioning as a way to engage the viewer with the work more personally. For instance, the still frame from Dyketactics in which a nude woman is sitting on a mirror and is taking a picture of her own genitals brings this woman’s sex to the forefront, but on her terms. This curious, observatory nature surrounding the human body is also seen with Muholi’s use of the mirror in Bona, Charlottesville, especially how it is used to block parts of the figure and instead focus on the calm facial expression of Muholi. These are minor details that contribute to the larger sense of self discovery in both of these works, which shows the timelessness of being queer, while also showing the evolution of queer representation in media.
<br>&emsp;Muholi identifying as a nonbinary lesbian artist is further evidence that no matter how the queer community was originally portrayed in media and art, the ways in which queer people are both represented and how they express themselves is continuously evolving. Both Hammer and Muholi used photography to expand upon the queer narrative in art; their actions and their artwork will allow future generations to observe and understand how both the lesbian/queer community and the representation of queer bodies has changed and continues to be redefined. In further broadening the public’s exposure to more members and nuanced aspects of the LGBTQ+ community, these artists demanded respect and acknowledgement, not approval. They defined the term ‘lesbian’ not as some male-dominated construct to further fetishize women and promote misogyny, but as what it always was: another form of love. The plight of the queer community is one that is felt by each generation, especially when most media portrayals of this community do not attempt to do anything to benefit it. Yet as more queer women reclaim their sexualities and bodies through art, especially through the lense, they can finally make that narrative their own, just as Hammer and Muholi did.
